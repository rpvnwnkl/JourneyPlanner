#User Statement
As a user, I want a tool to help choose a driving route for longer trips so that I can avoid dangerous and unpleasant driving situations.


##Acceptance:
* Accessible on web and mobile
* Takes into account weather patterns, traffic patterns, daylight, and other driving conditions
* Focus is as tool for longer trips, shorter trips would not see as much benefit

##Questions:
* Is open weather data available?
* Does google's nav features export?
* Is historical rush hour traffic available (traffic flow data)
* what factors affect driving pleasantness?
