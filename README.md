#User Statement
As a user, I want a tool to help choose a driving route for longer trips so that I can avoid dangerous and unpleasant driving situations.


##Acceptance:
* Accessible on web and mobile
* Takes into account weather patterns, traffic patterns, daylight, and other driving conditions
* Focus is as tool for longer trips, shorter trips would not see as much benefit

##Questions:
* Is open weather data available?
* Does google's nav features export?
* Is historical rush hour traffic available (traffic flow data)
* what factors affect driving pleasantness?

##Weather Data:
Recommend looking into NOWA forecast access/info

for example:

* http://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=NWS&issuedby=GYX&product=AFD&format=CI&version=1&glossary=1&highlight=off
* http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?zoneid=MEZ021

This information could be parsed and then interpreted into meaningful data
